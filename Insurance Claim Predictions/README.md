# INTRODUCTION
Insurance companies are a fast-growing, industry. It has a great role in ensuring the economic well-being of a country. Insurance providers always make a great effort, with the growing insurance claim cost or claim loss because of insurance claim fraud. Insurance companies have business problems, such as risk assessment, classification of policyholders and resource allocation, insurance claim classification and prediction in the insurance claim handling process.

 

Insurance claim is a basic problem in insurance companies. Insurance insurers always have a challenge to the growing insurance claim loss. Because there is the occurrence of claim fraud and the volume of claim data increases in the insurance companies. As a result, it is difficult to classify the insured claim status during the claim review process. Therefore, the study aimed to build a machine learning model that classifies and makes motor insurance claim status predictions in a machine learning approach.

 

These insurance business problems were not solved using traditional analytical approaches, including regression and linear programming. Nowadays, an insurance corporation has been struggling (stressed) to get the best methods that handle transactional data and risk management data for years.
