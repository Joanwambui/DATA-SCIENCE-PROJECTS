# DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECTS

# A collection of data science projects that involve the following:

Understanding the problem to be solved.

Data collecction and uploads of the datasets used for the projects.

Data exploration and cleaning prior to building models

Feature engineering to create new features from the existing data making it easier for the model to have accurate predictions

Model selection to ensure the best machine learning model is used as per the data provided

Model training to train our data

Model evaluation to evaluate the performance on a test set

Model deployment to a production environment 

Model Improvement based on the perfomance of the deployed model
